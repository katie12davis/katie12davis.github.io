        <h1>Passport Power - is it all that important?</h1>        
        <h9>A passport is one of the most powerful and important documents that someone can own, which some individuals are willing <br>
            to spend up to $2.9 million dollars for a new one. A new citizenship and passport enables escape from war
            <br> and instability and eases work and travel.
        </h9> 
        <h9>       
            <br> <br><i>But what does a powerful passport mean for the country named on its cover? </i>
        </h9> 
        <h9><br>
            <br>
            The aim of my project is to establish how important passport power is to a country,
             in particular to its economy and its political stability. Whilst there are a <br> multitude
              of factors I could have looked at, I have picked ones that can be logically connected with
               passport power and global mobility. I have used global data for this to enable the broadest investigation possible.

    <h8> The Economy </h8> <br><br>
    <h9>
        Whilst it varies at the top, higher scored countries have the strongest GDPs.
         <br>Whereas countries scoring 105 or below, predominantly have a GDP/capita less than $10,000.
         <br><br>
The trends for international tourism and export dependency are similar, in that countries with a low score are have a<br>
 lower dependency on exports and lower tourism numbers, and those with a high score vary more.
 <br><br>
When looking at less developed Regions, there is a stronger relationship between export dependency and passport power.<br>
 A strong passport can enable local entrepreneurs to more easily sell their goods abroad, which is less <br>likely to have
  an impact in already highly developed nations, but for less developed nations this could be a powerful change.
  <br><br>
With international tourism, it seems a country with a stronger passport is more appealing to visit, likely because <br>
 passport agreements are often bilateral. So a higher score often means more passports can easily visit your country.<br>
  But a strong passport does not induce travel outwards. 
  <br><br>
I expected a stronger passport would correlate with high remittance dependency, in particular in LICs as it<br> eases mobility.
 However countries with strong passports are highly unlikely to rely largely on remittances,<br> and weak passports rely on them
  much more, especially in the Caribbean.<br> However in Africa there is a slight trend with some countries that a stronger<br> passport
   correlates with increased remittance reliance.

        Political Stability
    </h8>
<br> <br>
    <h9>
        
There is an incredibly strong correlation between passport scores and the peacefulness/fragility of a nation.
 It is likely that citizens <br> from more stable nations are seen as less of a threat, so are more likely to gain visa-free travel 
 or visa on a arrival agreements <br> from other countries.
 <br><br>
Ease of doing business measures regulations directly  affecting businesses and 
it seems countries with more<br> powerful passports have more favourable regulations, likely 
because they are more outward looking and <br> friendly as a nation, so are more likely to focus
 on business, rather than corruption.

        Overall it does seem that a strong passport is more beneficial than simply easing the process of going on holiday. <br>
         Especially for low income countries where it creates a better environment for growth, allowing a diversification of <br>
         income into exports and tourism. <br>

    <h8> Data </h8>
    <br> <br>
    <h9>
Passport ranking was obtained from the Henley & Partners API, using a colab loop, used for later yearly and WOS data. <br>
 For this to be replicated yearly, ‘2023’ must simply be added to my year definition and the code rerun. <br> <br>

     <b>  Henley API Cleaning </b></a> 
<br><br><br>
For World Bank data I used their API with specified years for each chart, this can be replicated whenever <br>
new data is released by changing the year and uploading this data into the vega-code. <br> <br>

The FSI, GPI and Countries currently at war data was downloaded in CSV files and merged in colab or vega. <br> <br>

    <h8> Challenges in data cleaning/analysis</h8>
    <Br> <Br>
    <h9>
My map had the most issues. I inserted a year slider which would not work because I was using the topojson as my first data source, <br>
and looking up passport data onto it which worked for only one year. By starting with passport data and looking up the topojson, <br>
the slider worked. I found alpha3 using pycountry, and matched region_id with region names.
<br> <br>
There were also issues presenting the score, because I wanted to show both score and rank but needed a score inverse so both <br>
 would work in the same direction with blue representing good. Calculating the inverse in vega did not work since 2007, 2009 <br>
 and certain countries had 0 scores due to an API fault, so the inverse calculated as infinity breaking the map. So I created <br>
  a unique number for every row of data (year and country). Which I matched with the inverse score calculated elsewhere, where <br>
  score ‘0’s had been dropped so no infinity would be calculated. Whilst some data is now missing, this would have been the case <br>
   regardless.
<br> <br>   
World Bank data misses countries in recent years so I manually chose the most recent year with maximum country variation.
